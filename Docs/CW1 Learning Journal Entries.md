Object only rotating to -180 degrees then stopping. Was using the simple method of transform.rotation =. Overcame this bug by using Unity built in function &quot;transform.rotate&quot;.

Object thinks it is always going to fall off the side. Fixed by adjusting variables of the floor dimensions

Object thinks the rotation is always facing off the floor. Problem with converting unity transform.rotation values to readable numbers. Fixed by converting to EulerAngles method
